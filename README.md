# Data-Retrieval-System-Data-Structures-and-Algorithims-in-C-Final-Project-
This project executes a list of tasks such as reading and writing to/from a .txt file, traversing 2D arrays, implementing a bubble sort algorithm, and calculating the frequency of a word in a 2D array.

In the d1-d4.txt files were used to test the algorithim created. The stopwords.txt and the specialcharecters.txt files were used to traverse and remove values from d1-d4.txt that also showed up in the stopwords.txt and the specialcharecters.txt files
